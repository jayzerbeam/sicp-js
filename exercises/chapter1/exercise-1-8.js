/*
 * Exercise 1.8
 *
 * Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
 * approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by
 * the value [FORMULA, REPLACE]
 *
 * Use this formula to implement a cube-root function analogous to the
 * square-root function. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement
 * Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and
 * cube-root functions.)
